# The Game of Life
This repo contains a very basic C++ implementation of the game of life from John Horton Conway based on the SFML graphic library.

## Requirements
* [g++](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or equivalent C++ compiler (compatible with C++11)
* [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
* [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php) graphics library

## How to use the code
The `game_of_life.h` file contains all the basic functionality required to run the game of life. The `main.cpp` file contains a simple example.

To compile and execute the example code just use this command:
```
make; ./main.exe
```
